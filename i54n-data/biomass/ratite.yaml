display_name: Ostrich Manure
description: >
  Droppings from *Struthio camelus*, the world's largest bird. Ostrich manure is a high-nitrogen, mineral-rich excrement
  commonly used in African agriculture, with increasing interest in anaerobic digestion for methane and fertilizer recovery.

classification:
  kingdom: Animalia
  phylum: Chordata
  class: Aves
  order: Struthioniformes
  family: Struthionidae
  genus: Struthio
  species: camelus

biomass_type: excrement
source_animals: [ostrich]
collection_method: dry_sweep_or_manual
form: semi_dry_pellet
color: brownish_black
odor: strong_nitrogenic
handling_precautions: >
  Use gloves and respiratory protection in enclosed spaces. Manure can emit ammonia and carry pathogens if not composted.

composition:
  moisture_content_percent: 55  # lower than cow, higher than poultry
  total_solids_percent: 45
  volatile_solids_percent: 70
  nitrogen_percent: 1.6
  phosphorus_percent: 1.2
  potassium_percent: 0.9
  fiber_content_percent: 15

biogas_yield_estimate:
  methane_m3_per_kg_vs: 0.35
  notes: >
    Comparable to poultry litter when pretreated or mixed with higher-moisture substrates like food waste.

use_cases:
  - anaerobic_digestion
  - composting
  - soil_amendment
  - biochar_feedstock

biosafety:
  bsl: 1
  zoonotic_risk: low
  notes: >
    Minimal risk when handled with standard farm biosafety practices; pathogen load drops after digestion or composting.
