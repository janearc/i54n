reaction_class: aerobic_bacterial_culture
version: 1.0

description: >
  Standard aerobic culture of bacterial organisms in liquid or semi-solid media.
  Used in diagnostic microbiology, molecular biology, and biosafety-level research.

inputs_required:
  - water
  - growth_medium
  - bacterial_inoculum

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [30, 42]  # strain-dependent
  pH: [6.5, 7.5]
  oxygen: aerobic
  agitation: optional  # depending on bioreactor and oxygenation strategy

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - dissolved_oxygen
  - turbidity
  - biomass_density

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - aeration
  - sampling
  - nutrient_feed (optional)

biosafety:
  bsl: 1_to_3
  select_agent: conditional
  containment: required_for_pathogenic_strains

notes: >
  This process can support both harmless lab strains (e.g., *E. coli* K-12) and BSL-2/3 organisms such as MRSA.
  Bioreactor instrumentation must match the required safety and monitoring levels for the selected strain.
