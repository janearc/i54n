reaction_class: batch_microbial_culture
display_name: Batch Microbial Culture
description: >
  Controlled batch growth of microbial biomass in a defined nutrient medium.
  Used for seed culture production, microbial biomass harvesting, recombinant protein expression, or pre-fermentation scale-up.

biomass:
  species: Saccharomyces_cerevisiae
  strain_notes: >
    Example strain for general batch culture. Can be replaced with E. coli, Lactobacillus,
    Pseudomonas, Clostridium, fungal strains, or custom engineered organisms.

inputs_required:
  - growth_medium (e.g., YPD, LB, MRS)
  - water
  - carbon_source (e.g., glucose, glycerol)
  - micronutrients
  - buffer (optional)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [20, 37]
  pH_range: [5.5, 7.5]
  oxygen: aerobic_or_microaerobic
  agitation: medium
  dwell_time_hours: [8, 48]

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - optical_density
  - dissolved_oxygen
  - carbon_source_depletion
  - biomass_yield

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - agitation
  - o2_injection_or_airflow
  - nutrient_feed (optional)
  - sampling_port
  - optical_monitoring (optional)

reaction_goals:
  - cell_mass_production
  - starter_culture_generation
  - expression_of_target_compound (optional)

notes:
  - Often used as a pre-step before transfer to larger fermenters or reactors.
  - Time and resource use are boundedâ€”no replenishment after start.
  - Many downstream processes rely on consistent, reproducible batch cultures for quality control.
