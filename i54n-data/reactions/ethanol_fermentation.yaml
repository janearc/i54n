reaction_class: ethanol_fermentation
display_name: Ethanol Fermentation (Yeast)
description: >
  Anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrate-rich substrates using yeast, typically Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
  to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. Common in beverage alcohol, industrial fuel production, and bioactive compound extraction.

biomass:
  species: Saccharomyces_cerevisiae
  strain_notes: >
    Typical high-alcohol-tolerant wine or champagne yeast. Variant strains may produce differing flavor compounds and tolerate varying sugar/osmotic levels.

inputs_required:
  - glucose
  - yeast_nutrients
  - water

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [20, 32]
  pH_range: [3.5, 5.5]
  oxygen: low_or_none
  osmolality_tolerance: medium
  salinity: low
  light: none

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - gravity
  - abv
  - co2_output

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - nutrient_feed
  - co2_release
  - agitation (optional)
  - sampling_port

reaction_goals:
  - ethanol
  - co2

notes:
  - May require degassing or agitation if krausen forms and yeast adhesion becomes problematic.
  - Ethanol toxicity can inhibit fermentation >14â€“16% ABV depending on strain and conditions.
  - Gravity readings should be adjusted for temperature during active fermentation.
