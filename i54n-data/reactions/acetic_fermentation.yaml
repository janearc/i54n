reaction_class: acetic_fermentation
display_name: Acetic Acid Fermentation
description: >
  Aerobic oxidation of ethanol into acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria.
  Used in vinegar production, kombucha secondary fermentation, and as a microbial preservative process.

biomass:
  species: Acetobacter_aceti
  strain_notes: >
    Robust acetic acid producer with tolerance to moderate ethanol levels and oxygen-rich environments.
    Other strains may offer higher acid yields or work better in symbiosis (e.g., with kombucha SCOBYs).

inputs_required:
  - ethanol_solution (e.g., fermented wine, beer, or wash)
  - oxygen
  - water (optional, depending on dilution)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [25, 32]
  pH_range: [3.0, 5.0]
  ethanol_percent_start: [5, 12]
  oxygen: high
  agitation: low_or_none
  salinity: low

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - gravity
  - abv
  - dissolved_o2
  - acidity (titration or inferred)

control_capabilities_required:
  - airflow_control
  - temp_control
  - sampling_port
  - headspace_monitoring
  - surface_exposure_adjustment (optional)

reaction_goals:
  - acetic_acid
  - flavor_development
  - ethanol_conversion

notes:
  - May form a surface film ("mother") that contributes to oxygen transfer and microbial growth.
  - Often used as a secondary fermentation following ethanol production.
  - Process is exothermicâ€”heat management may be needed in large volumes.
  - Can be accelerated using forced aeration or trickle bed reactors.
