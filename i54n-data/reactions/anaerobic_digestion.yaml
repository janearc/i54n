reaction_class: anaerobic_digestion
display_name: Anaerobic Digestion (Biogas Production)
description: >
  Multi-stage anaerobic microbial breakdown of organic material to produce biogas,
  primarily methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), with a residual digestate byproduct.
  Used in waste treatment, energy generation, and carbon loop balancing.

biomass:
  species: mixed_anaerobic_consortium
  strain_notes: >
    Contains hydrolytic, acidogenic, acetogenic, and methanogenic organisms.
    Process relies on stability between these microbial guilds, often sourced from sludge or cow rumen.

inputs_required:
  - organic_waste (e.g., food scraps, manure, plant biomass)
  - water
  - heat
  - micronutrients (optional for yield optimization)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [30, 40]  # mesophilic
  pH_range: [6.5, 8.0]
  osmolality_tolerance: moderate
  oxygen: none (strictly anaerobic)
  agitation: low_or_periodic
  dwell_time_days: [15, 30]

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - gas_output_volume
  - gas_composition (CH₄ %, CO₂ %, H₂S trace)
  - volatile_solids
  - chemical_oxygen_demand (optional)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - gas_capture_system
  - inert_headspace_or_seal
  - feedstock_maceration (optional)
  - recirculation (optional)
  - digestate_separation (optional)

reaction_goals:
  - methane_production
  - waste_stabilization
  - digestate_capture_or_use

notes:
  - Highly sensitive to shock loading or pH drift.
  - Sulfide scrubbers may be needed for high-H₂S waste streams.
  - Scaled systems often integrate gas compression and CHP (combined heat & power).
  - Performance improves with pre-digestion treatments like enzymatic hydrolysis.
