reaction_class: photosynthesis
display_name: Algal Photosynthesis (Phototrophic Biomass Production)
description: >
  Light-driven conversion of CO₂ into organic biomass using phototrophic organisms such as algae or cyanobacteria.
  Requires sustained illumination in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectrum, with nutrient and CO₂ enrichment.

biomass:
  species: Spirulina_platensis
  strain_notes: >
    High-efficiency cyanobacterium tolerant of elevated pH, warm temperatures, and dense culture.
    Other variants may require different salinity or temperature profiles.

inputs_required:
  - water
  - nitrogen_source (e.g., urea or nitrate)
  - phosphate
  - trace_minerals
  - carbon_dioxide
  - light (400–700nm PAR)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [30, 38]
  pH_range: [8.5, 10.5]
  salinity: low_to_medium
  oxygen: saturated_or_high
  redox: oxidative
  light_intensity_lux: [15_000, 30_000]
  light_cycle: [16, 8] # hours light, dark

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - tds
  - lux
  - osmolality
  - dissolved_o2
  - co2_input_rate
  - biomass_density (optional via turbidity or chlorophyll fluorescence)

control_capabilities_required:
  - light_control (spectrum, intensity)
  - co2_injection
  - temp_control
  - agitation
  - sampling_port
  - nutrient_feed
  - gas_exchange_valve

reaction_goals:
  - biomass_production
  - oxygen
  - carbon_capture

notes:
  - Excess biomass may require periodic harvesting or recirculation filtering.
  - Closed-loop gas management systems can optimize carbon efficiency and reduce O₂ inhibition.
  - Shallow, wide reactors with distributed lighting optimize yield per watt.
