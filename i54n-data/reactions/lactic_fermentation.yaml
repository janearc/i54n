reaction_class: lactic_fermentation
display_name: Lactic Acid Fermentation (Homo- and Heterofermentative)
description: >
  Anaerobic fermentation of sugars by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), primarily producing lactic acid,
  sometimes alongside ethanol, CO₂, and other minor byproducts. Used in food preservation, probiotic production,
  and acidification processes.

biomass:
  species: Lactobacillus_plantarum
  strain_notes: >
    Tolerates a wide pH range and high salinity, performs well in vegetable ferments and controlled starter cultures.
    Other LAB species may produce CO₂ or ethanol depending on homo/heterofermentative pathways.

inputs_required:
  - glucose_or_sucrose
  - salt (NaCl or similar)
  - water
  - optional_starters (if not wild fermentation)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [18, 35]
  pH_range: [3.2, 6.5]
  salinity: [2, 8] # percent NaCl by weight
  oxygen: low_or_none
  osmolality_tolerance: high
  agitation: none

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - redox_potential (optional)
  - salinity
  - gas_output (optional)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - anaerobic_headspace
  - sampling_port
  - salinity_adjustment (optional)
  - starter_injection (optional)

reaction_goals:
  - lactic_acid
  - flavor_development
  - microbial_stabilization

notes:
  - Fermentation is often self-limiting as pH drops.
  - Wild fermentation benefits from observational logging, especially krausen behavior, gas release, and sedimentation.
  - May benefit from initial salinity check and periodic pH trending to confirm stability.
