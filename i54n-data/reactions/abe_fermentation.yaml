reaction_class: abe_fermentation
display_name: Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) Fermentation
description: >
  A mixed-acid anaerobic fermentation process using Clostridium species to convert carbohydrates
  into acetone, butanol, and ethanol in varying ratios. Typically performed in strict anaerobic
  environments with pH-controlled metabolic switching and high osmotic stress tolerance.

biomass:
  species: Clostridium_acetobutylicum
  strain_notes: >
    High-yield ABE variant, sensitive to pH shift near 5.0 for metabolic phase transition.
    Requires heat shock pretreatment to sporulate if starting from plate.

inputs_required:
  - glucose
  - yeast_extract
  - ammonium_sulfate
  - mineral_salts
  - phosphate_buffer
  - anaerobic_conditions

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [34, 37]
  pH_range:
    acidogenic_phase: [6.0, 6.5]
    solventogenic_phase: [4.5, 5.2]
  redox: strict_anaerobic
  agitation: low_or_none
  osmolality_tolerance: high
  salinity: low
  light: none

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - osmolality
  - tds
  - abv
  - gas_output (H2, CO2)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - anaerobic_headspace
  - pH_modulation (acid/base addition)
  - nutrient_feed
  - gas_valve_control
  - low_shear_agitation (optional)
  - sampling_port

reaction_goals:
  - butanol
  - acetone
  - ethanol
  - hydrogen (optional co-product)

notes:
  - Transition from acidogenic to solventogenic phase must be closely monitored via pH and gas output.
  - Requires careful sterilization and pretreatment to avoid contamination and ensure sporulation.
  - Butanol production efficiency is sensitive to osmotic shock and trace nutrient depletion.
