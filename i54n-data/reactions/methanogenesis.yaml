reaction_class: methanogenesis
display_name: Targeted Methane Production via Methanogenesis
description: >
  Biological conversion of carbon compounds to methane (CH₄) by methanogenic archaea.
  Operates under strict anaerobic conditions and optimized for energy recovery, biogas quality,
  and carbon loop integration.

biomass:
  species: Methanobrevibacter_smithii
  strain_notes: >
    Obligate anaerobe optimized for high methane yield. Other methanogens may include Methanosarcina,
    Methanococcus, or co-cultures with hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic pathways.

inputs_required:
  - carbon_substrate (e.g., acetate, formate, CO₂ + H₂)
  - water
  - micronutrients (e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt)
  - buffer (optional)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [35, 55]  # mesophilic to thermophilic
  pH_range: [6.8, 7.2]
  oxygen: none (strict anaerobe)
  pressure_bar: [1, 3]  # sealed vessels often used
  osmolality_tolerance: medium
  agitation: none_or_low

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - gas_output_volume
  - gas_composition (CH₄ %, CO₂ %, H₂S trace)
  - substrate_consumption (e.g., acetate levels)
  - redox_potential (optional)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - gas_capture_system
  - inert_headspace_management
  - sampling_port
  - feed_control (e.g., acetate dosing)
  - optional_nutrient_dosing

reaction_goals:
  - methane_generation
  - gas_purification_or_use
  - closed_loop_carbon_balance

notes:
  - Prefer purified or pretreated substrates—often used downstream of hydrolysis or ABE digestion.
  - Strict anaerobiosis is critical—O₂ exposure can be lethal.
  - Suitable for continuous or batch operation; frequently integrated with CHP or flare systems.
