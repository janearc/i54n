display_name: Guano (Seabird or Bat)
description: >
  Highly nitrogen-rich excrement from seabirds or bats. Historically used as fertilizer,
  and increasingly considered in biochemical and anaerobic digestion systems as a potent
  nitrogen supplement or metabolic catalyst. Requires care due to pathogen and ammonia load.

classification:
  type: excrement
  origin: avian_or_chiropteran
  usage_contexts:
    - anaerobic_digestion
    - compost_activation
    - soil_enrichment

biomass_properties:
  moisture_content_percent: [10, 30]
  nitrogen_percent_dry: [8, 16]
  phosphorus_percent_dry: [8, 20]
  potassium_percent_dry: [1, 2]
  carbon_nitrogen_ratio: [4, 6]
  trace_elements:
    - calcium
    - sulfur
    - magnesium
    - iron
  pathogen_risk: moderate
  volatility: high_ammonia
  odor_profile: pungent_uric

growth_environment:
  collection_notes: >
    Bat guano often harvested from cave environments, requires filtration and drying;
    seabird guano collected from island colonies or coastal cliffs. Risk of histoplasmosis
    in enclosed environments without PPE.

biosafety:
  bsl: 2
  notes: >
    May contain fungal spores and enteric pathogens. PPE, ventilation, and respirator advised
    when handling raw material.

extraction_recommendations:
  - compost_with_c_high_biomass
  - dilute_in_slurry_for_digesters
  - combine_with_urease_inhibitor_for_safe_storage

applications:
  - fertilizer
  - biogas_booster
  - nitrate_feedstock
  - historical_explosives_feedstock (not recommended)
