display_name: Owl Feces (Pelletized Guano)
description: >
  Fecal matter and regurgitated pellet waste from owls, often composed of digested meat proteins, fur, and bone fragments.
  Though not traditionally used in large-scale digestion, it contains nitrogenous material and could be relevant for micro-scale or educational bioprocesses.

  phylum: Chordata
  class: Aves
  order: Strigiformes
  common_name: Owl

metabolic_origin: carnivore_digestion

recommended_uses:
  - micro_digester_feedstock
  - organic fertilizer (non-edible crops)
  - nitrogen supplementation
  - lab-scale experimental digestion

risks_and_handling:
  - Use gloves and mask during handling due to pathogen potential.
  - Avoid use in edible plant production due to zoonotic risk.
  - Not suitable for direct human contact or open-system bioreactors.
