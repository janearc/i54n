reaction_class: synthetic_reduction
display_name: Synthetic Reduction Reaction
description: >
  A controlled chemical reduction process using defined catalysts and reductants to convert substrate molecules
  to lower oxidation states. Often used in pharmaceutical synthesis, fuel refining, and industrial organic chemistry.

biomass:
  species: none
  reaction_type: abiotic
  catalyst: optional

inputs_required:
  - substrate (e.g., ketone, ester, alkene)
  - reductant (e.g., hydrogen gas, NaBH4, LiAlH4)
  - solvent (e.g., ethanol, THF, water)
  - catalyst (e.g., Pd/C, Ni, enzyme)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [0, 150]
  pressure_bar: [1, 10]
  pH_range: [neutral_or_ignored]
  oxygen: inert_only
  agitation: required

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pressure
  - reaction_time
  - tds (if aqueous)
  - redox_potential (if applicable)
  - gas_flow (hydrogen use or release)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - pressure_regulation
  - inert_gas_injection
  - agitation
  - catalyst_feed (optional)
  - sampling_port
  - reaction_quench (optional)

reaction_goals:
  - product_reduction (e.g., alcohol, alkane, amine)
  - precursor_transformation
  - solvent_recovery (optional)

notes:
  - Reactions may be exothermic; thermal control and pressure relief valves required.
  - Inert atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) critical for safety and yield in most systems.
  - Catalyst recovery or filtration may be needed post-process.
