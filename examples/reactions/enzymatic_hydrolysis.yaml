reaction_class: enzymatic_hydrolysis
display_name: Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Biomass
description: >
  Catalytic breakdown of complex macromolecules (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, protein)
  into simpler monomers using specific enzymes under controlled conditions.
  Used for producing fermentable sugars prior to alcohol production, or as part of waste valorization and feedstock conversion.

biomass:
  species: enzyme_cocktail
  strain_notes: >
    May include cellulase, hemicellulase, amylase, protease, pectinase, or ligninase depending on substrate.
    Can be sourced from fungal fermentation (e.g., Aspergillus), commercial mixes, or recombinant production.

inputs_required:
  - pretreated_biomass (e.g., shredded plant waste, cooked grain)
  - water
  - enzyme_mix (custom or off-shelf)
  - optional_buffer (e.g., citrate, phosphate)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [40, 60]
  pH_range: [4.5, 6.0]
  osmolality_tolerance: low_to_moderate
  agitation: medium
  dwell_time_hours: [4, 72]

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - viscosity
  - tds
  - reducing_sugar_concentration
  - gravity

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - agitation
  - timed_enzyme_dosing (optional)
  - viscosity_monitoring (optional)
  - sampling_port

reaction_goals:
  - polysaccharide_conversion
  - sugar_release (glucose, xylose, arabinose, etc.)
  - fermentation_ready_feedstock

notes:
  - Substrate often requires physical or chemical pre-treatment (e.g., steam explosion, dilute acid).
  - Enzyme efficiency depends heavily on pH and temp matching.
  - Output typically fed directly into ethanol, butanol, or lactic acid fermentation processes.
