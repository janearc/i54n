reaction_class: solid_state_fermentation
display_name: Solid State Fermentation (SSF)
description: >
  A surface-driven fermentation process in low-moisture, non-submerged substrates.
  Common in traditional fermentation starters (koji, tempeh), enzyme production, and fungal-based bioproducts.
  Requires tight thermal and humidity control, oxygenation, and non-liquid nutrient delivery.

biomass:
  species: Aspergillus_oryzae
  strain_notes: >
    High-amylase koji mold, used for soy fermentation, enzyme production, and starch conversion.
    Other organisms may include Rhizopus, Monascus, or Bacillus species for diverse applications.

inputs_required:
  - substrate (e.g., rice, soy, wheat bran)
  - inoculant (starter mold spores or culture)
  - humidity
  - oxygen

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [28, 38]
  humidity_percent: [85, 95]
  pH_range: [5.0, 6.5]
  oxygen: high
  agitation: none (optional remixing)

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - humidity
  - pH (optional)
  - gas_output (optional)
  - substrate_color (optical monitoring)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - humidity_control
  - oxygenation
  - substrate_rotation_or_mixing (optional)
  - sampling_port
  - camera_monitoring (recommended)

reaction_goals:
  - enzyme_production
  - flavor_development
  - fermentation_starter_material

notes:
  - Typically done in shallow trays or stacked flatbed fermenters for surface area and airflow.
  - Can be initiated in a humid incubator cabinet or climate-controlled SSF chamber.
  - Highly sensitive to contamination; sterile handling and well-timed inoculation are key.
