display_name: Natural Organic Reduction (Human Composting)
description: >
  An aerobic thermophilic biological process used for the controlled decomposition
  of human or large mammalian remains into stable, soil-like material. This reaction
  is conducted in enclosed vessels with oxygen control, moisture monitoring, and
  temperature regulation. Designed for environmentally conscious body disposition.
