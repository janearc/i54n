display_name: Owl Guano Anaerobic Digestion for Biogas
description: >
  Anaerobic digestion of owl guano for biogas (methane) production. Optimized for high-nitrogen,
  high-mineral content, with slow input throughput due to volume constraints. Useful in research
  and niche bioenergy applications.

safety_notes: >
  Owl guano may contain zoonotic pathogens. Handle with biosafety protocols consistent with BSL-2 lab practices,
  including aerosol minimization and sample deactivation prior to open handling.
