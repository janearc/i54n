display_name: Fungal Fermentation Pathway (Cassava to Mycoprotein)
description: >
  A defined fungal metabolic pathway and fermentation route for converting cassava-derived sugars
  into a mycoprotein biomass resembling FermoteinÂ®. This pathway focuses on the aerobic cultivation
  of filamentous fungi with high-protein yields, low lipid content, and fibrous texture.

  - name: cassava_starch_hydrolysate
    type: hydrolyzed_polysaccharide
    composition:
      glucose: 65%
      maltose: 15%
