reaction_class: continuous_culture
display_name: Continuous Microbial Culture (Chemostat)
description: >
  A bioreaction model in which fresh medium is continuously added and culture broth is removed
  at a fixed rate to maintain steady-state conditions. Used in industrial enzyme production,
  biopolymer synthesis, metabolic studies, and precision fermentation.

biomass:
  species: Escherichia_coli
  strain_notes: >
    Example strain for continuous culture. Replaceable with yeast, Bacillus, Clostridium,
    filamentous fungi, or engineered strains depending on application.

inputs_required:
  - sterile_growth_medium
  - carbon_source (e.g., glucose, glycerol)
  - oxygen_or_alternative_electron_acceptor
  - antifoam_agent (optional)
  - buffer

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [30, 37]
  pH_range: [6.5, 7.5]
  oxygen: aerobic
  agitation: high
  dilution_rate_per_hour: [0.1, 0.6]

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - dissolved_oxygen
  - optical_density
  - nutrient_concentration
  - metabolite_levels
  - biomass_yield
  - flow_rates (inflow/outflow)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - agitation
  - sterile_medium_feed
  - overflow_control
  - pH_adjustment
  - oxygenation
  - sensor_driven_feedback_loops

reaction_goals:
  - steady_state_metabolite_production
  - biomass_maintenance
  - precision fermentation

notes:
  - Critical for studies on growth kinetics and metabolic flux analysis.
  - Requires rigorous sterilization and flow control systems.
  - Often integrated with automated sampling and downstream processing pipelines.
  - Dilution rate must be matched precisely to growth rate to avoid washout.
