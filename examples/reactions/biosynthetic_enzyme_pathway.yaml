reaction_class: biosynthetic_enzyme_pathway
display_name: Recombinant Biosynthesis of Proteins or Enzymes
description: >
  Controlled biological expression of target proteins through genetically engineered host organisms.
  Used in the production of pharmaceutical compounds, industrial enzymes, and synthetic biology applications.
  Requires precise environmental regulation, sterile conditions, and often multi-stage fermentation protocols.

biomass:
  species: Escherichia_coli
  strain_notes: >
    High-expression plasmid strain with inducible promoter (e.g., T7). May require antibiotic selection,
    IPTG induction, and heat shock transformation. Other chassis organisms: Saccharomyces, CHO, Pichia.

inputs_required:
  - sterile_growth_medium
  - inducers (e.g., IPTG, arabinose)
  - antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin)
  - oxygen (aerobic culture)
  - carbon_source (e.g., glucose or glycerol)
  - buffer (e.g., phosphate)

environmental_targets:
  temperature_c: [28, 42]
  pH_range: [6.8, 7.4]
  dissolved_o2: >40%
  redox: oxidative
  osmolality_tolerance: medium
  agitation: high

monitoring_metrics:
  - temperature
  - pH
  - dissolved_o2
  - tds
  - optical_density
  - osmolality
  - pressure (if sealed or gas-fed)
  - inductor concentration (optional)

control_capabilities_required:
  - temp_control
  - o2_injection_or_airflow
  - agitation
  - nutrient_feed
  - sampling_port
  - sterile_steam_or_uv_sanitization
  - multi-phase_control (e.g., growth â†’ induction)

reaction_goals:
  - target_protein_expression
  - high_cell_density
  - post-process recovery (e.g., filtration, centrifugation, affinity resin)

notes:
  - Downstream purification steps not included in this process definition but expected.
  - Aeration and oxygen availability are major rate-limiting factors in high-density cultures.
  - Risk of contamination or plasmid loss necessitates robust sterilization and monitoring protocols.
