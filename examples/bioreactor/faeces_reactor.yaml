display_name: JP7 Shallow Agricultural Anaerobic Digester (5000mÂ³)
description: >
  A high-surface-area, shallow-depth bioreactor optimized for anaerobic digestion
  of animal waste (e.g., bovine, equine) and agricultural runoff. Designed for methane
  and biofuel production with onboard monitoring and processor linkage. Can be deployed
  at industrial scale for sustainable rural energy.
