version: 1.0
description: >
  Defines a control-layer request used to query the current state of a node, including readiness,
  health, capacity, or active job metadata. This is distinct from a stat_emit, as it is explicitly requested
  by a controller or orchestrator. The node replies with an `ncp_response`.
