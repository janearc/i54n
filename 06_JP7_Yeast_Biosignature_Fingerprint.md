# JP7 Yeast Biosignature Fingerprint Patent

**Title:** Biosignature Mapping of Microbial Metabolic Response in Osmostatic Fermentation

**Abstract:**
This patent defines a method for capturing and analyzing the biosignature of yeast strains (or equivalent biomass) undergoing osmostatic fermentation. The biosignature comprises time-series metabolic data—including fermentation rate, substrate depletion, intermediate metabolite ratios, and stress responses—measured via direct or inferred sensor observation. The signature enables strain-specific process modeling, deviation detection, and predictive tuning of bioreactor behavior based on known microbial tolerances and historical fingerprint libraries.

**Field of Invention:**
The invention relates to microbial physiology, metabolic monitoring, and controlled fermentation under high-osmolality conditions. It leverages biosignatures as diagnostic and predictive tools in open-loop biochemical systems.

**Background:**
Yeast behavior under extreme osmolality or ABV load is poorly captured by conventional metrics. Fermentation can stall, mutate, or deviate depending on nutrient availability, metabolic fatigue, or localized inhibition. This invention characterizes yeast not just by outcome, but by *trajectory*—using biosignature mapping to understand and respond to live metabolic changes.

**Summary:**
A biosignature is a structured, timestamped trace of:
- Sugar/alcohol ratio over time
- CO₂ evolution rate or dissolved gas levels
- Osmotic pressure trajectory
- pH trend and buffering behavior
- Heat generation or consumption rate
- Viscosity change rate
- Intermediate metabolite appearance/disappearance (e.g. glycerol, acetaldehyde)

These readings are collected continuously or discretely and associated with a microbial strain and recipe. When compared against reference biosignatures, deviations can indicate:
- Strain fatigue or stress
- Insufficient nutrient load
- Over-concentration or osmolock threshold breach
- Mutation or contamination

**Detailed Description:**
- **Signature Generation:** Sensor logs and calculated metabolic deltas are recorded as a structured fingerprint during fermentation.
- **Fingerprint Comparison:** Matching, scoring, or clustering against a library of known yeast-strain fingerprints.
- **Forecasting:** Predictive modeling of trajectory slope, signature completion, or failure conditions.
- **Diagnostic Use:** Enables automated reactor feedback or post-batch analysis for future tuning.
