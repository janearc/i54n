what is this stuff
===
i've developed a novel fermentation process called osmostatic fermentation. it is clear to me
that this is patentable and there are some additional things that go along with this.

because of this i want to commit my work here, as i am working on codifying this. i'm in the
middle of a complicated international move and can't actually do this right this very second,
but intend to pursue this as soon as i'm settled in my new home.

don't steal my stuff, but if you want to talk to me about this i'm a huge nerd about all things fungus
