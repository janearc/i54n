# JP7 Fingerprint Patent

**Title:** Chemo-Physical Fingerprint of Osmostatically Stabilized Biological Products

**Abstract:**
This patent defines a unique chemo-physical fingerprint for products produced by the JP7 Method. The fingerprint comprises a set of measurable parameters—including residual sugar (or solute content), alcohol or solvent concentration, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and specific metabolite ratios—that collectively serve as a forensic marker to verify the product's origin and quality. The method allows comparison of real-time or post-ferment measurements against a reference signature, enabling product authentication, quality assurance, and detection of unauthorized replication.

**Field of Invention:**
The invention relates to analytical characterization and quality control methods for biological products produced under controlled high-osmolality conditions, specifically leveraging a reproducible chemo-physical fingerprint as a product identity and provenance mechanism.

**Background:**
Conventional fermentation lacks robust forensic identification of process outcomes. In high-osmolality stabilization, where yeast viability and metabolic output vary with minute changes in input or environment, traditional sensory and titer measurements fail to establish authenticity. This invention solves that by defining a stable, quantifiable fingerprint.

**Summary:**
The fingerprint includes:
- Residual solute concentration (e.g., sugar, salt)
- Alcohol or solvent concentration (ABV or %w/v)
- Osmolality (mOsm/kg)
- Viscosity (centipoise)
- Key metabolite ratios (e.g., glycerol:ethanol)
- Volatile profile via GC-MS
- Refractive index

These parameters are collected via sensors and laboratory instrumentation (NMR, refractometry, osmometry, GC-MS). Each batch of product can be mapped to a canonical fingerprint or variant class, creating a secure and reproducible signature that persists regardless of geography or production scale.

**Detailed Description:**
- **Measurement Parameters:** Core data includes osmotic load, ABV, viscosity, and targeted metabolite ratios.
- **Analytical Techniques:** GC-MS, NMR, refractometry, osmometry, and machine vision analysis where appropriate.
- **Use of Reference Fingerprints:** Comparison against a repository of known-good fingerprints allows authentication and process verification.
- **Forensic Applications:** Discrepancy analysis supports quality assurance, intellectual property enforcement, and clone detection.

**Claims (Draft):**
1. A method for characterizing a biological product, comprising measuring solute concentration, solvent concentration, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and specific metabolite ratios, and comparing the results to a canonical fingerprint.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the fingerprint is used to verify product authenticity and detect deviation from process specifications.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising comparison against a secure repository of registered product fingerprints for IP enforcement.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein live data from an instrumented bioreactor is used to project, validate, or match against the expected product fingerprint.

**Preferred Embodiments:**
- Fingerprint repository implemented as a cryptographically signed fingerprint registry.
- Live comparison and deviation scoring embedded in bioreactor control logic.
- Automated warnings issued when measured fingerprint diverges from expected tolerances.

**Industrial Applications:**
- Quality control and traceability in fermentation-based beverage production
- Anti-counterfeiting in high-value biochemical or pharmaceutical production
- Compliance verification in biofuel or metabolic engineering industries
