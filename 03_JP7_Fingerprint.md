# JP7 Fingerprint Patent

**Title:** Chemo-Physical Fingerprint of Osmostatically Stabilized Biological Products

**Abstract:**  
This patent defines a unique chemo-physical fingerprint for products produced by the JP7 Method. The fingerprint comprises a set of measurable parameters—including residual sugar (or solute content), alcohol or solvent concentration, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and specific metabolite ratios—that collectively serve as a forensic marker to verify the product's origin and quality. This approach enables product authentication independent of geographical origin, providing robust quality control and licensing leverage.

**Field of Invention:**  
The invention relates to analytical characterization methods for biological products, focusing on the identification and authentication of products produced under controlled high-osmolality conditions.

**Background:**  
Existing quality control measures in fermentation and bioprocessing do not adequately capture the unique metabolic signature of products produced via high-osmolality stabilization. This invention addresses that gap by establishing a reproducible fingerprint based on key chemical and physical parameters.

**Summary:**  
The fingerprint is determined by measuring parameters such as residual sugar or solute concentration, ABV or solvent concentration, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and specific metabolite ratios using analytical techniques like GC-MS, NMR, and refractometry. The measured values are then compared against a standard profile, enabling authentication and quality control.

**Detailed Description:**  
- **Measurement Parameters:** Includes solute concentration (e.g., sugar, salts), ABV (or solvent content), osmolality (mOsm/kg), viscosity (centipoise), and specific metabolite ratios (e.g., glycerol-to-ethanol, or other key markers).  
- **Analytical Techniques:** Utilizes GC-MS, NMR spectroscopy, osmometry, and refractometry to obtain precise measurements.  
- **Fingerprint Comparison:** The measured profile is compared to a predetermined tolerance band representing the JP7 Method output or other high-osmolality processes.  
- **Forensic Marker:** The combined set of parameters acts as a unique product signature, verifiable across different production sites.

**Claims (Draft):**  
1. A method for characterizing a biological product, comprising measuring solute concentration, solvent concentration, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and specific metabolite ratios, and comparing the results to a standard fingerprint for products produced by a high-osmolality stabilization process.  
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the fingerprint is used to verify product authenticity and process adherence independent of geographical origin.  
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising the use of the fingerprint for quality control, licensing validation, and detection of unauthorized product replication.

**Preferred Embodiments:**  
Embodiments include establishing a database of standard fingerprints and automated software for matching and deviation analysis, potentially integrated into a cloud-based service for real-time verification.

**Industrial Applications:**  
Applicable in verifying the quality and authenticity of products in biofuel production, high-stability beverage manufacturing, enzyme processes, and other industrial bioprocesses.
