# JP7 Recipe Interface Patent

**Title:** Biological Process Recipe Specification and Execution Format

**Abstract:**  
This patent describes a machine-readable specification format for encoding reproducible osmostatic brewing recipes. The format enables users to define detailed biological process recipes in a standardized, reproducible, and transmissible manner, capturing essential parameters such as target product, microbial strain characteristics, environmental tolerances, and process control commands. The innovation lies in its ontological approach, which formalizes the relationships between these parameters, thereby ensuring consistent outcomes and offering potential for trademarkable identity within the osmostatic brewing industry.

**Field of Invention:**  
The invention pertains to digital communication protocols and data formats for controlling biological process equipment, specifically focused on defining osmostatic brewing recipes. It provides a systematic method for capturing and transmitting the critical parameters that govern controlled microbial fermentation processes.

**Background:**  
Traditional brewing recipes are largely qualitative, relying on subjective judgment and imprecise measurements that often result in batch-to-batch variability. Osmostatic brewing, however, requires precise control over biological parameters—such as osmotic pressure, pH, and fermentation kinetics—to achieve consistent outcomes. Existing recipe formats fail to capture the complex interrelationships between these parameters. This specification addresses that gap by offering a structured, ontological schema that enables the reproducible execution of osmostatic brewing processes, ensuring both consistency and scalability.

**Summary:**  
This machine-readable schema is a YAML-based format designed to encapsulate the critical parameters for osmostatic brewing. Key elements include:
- **Target Product:** Definition of the desired final product.
- **Biomass:** Detailed specifications of the microbial strain, including tolerance thresholds and performance metrics.
- **Tolerances:** Precise environmental limits such as maximum osmotic pressure, acceptable pH ranges, and ABV or solvent concentration thresholds.
- **Controls:** Process commands for actions such as nutrient addition, temperature adjustments, dilution, and osmolocking triggers.
- **Versioning:** A mechanism to track revisions and ensure backward compatibility.

The ontological approach not only records numerical values but also delineates the causal relationships between process parameters and microbial responses, providing a comprehensive blueprint for reproducible brewing.

**Detailed Description:**  
- **Format Structure:**  
  The schema is organized into the following key sections:
  - `target_product`: Specifies the intended final product.
  - `biomass`: Describes the microbial strain used, along with its tolerance limits and performance data.
  - `tolerances`: Outlines critical environmental parameters, such as maximum osmotic pressure, pH, and ABV/solvent limits.
  - `controls`: Lists process commands (e.g., scheduled nutrient additions, temperature adjustments, dilution triggers, and osmolocking events).
  - `version`: Indicates the schema version to support iterative improvements.
  
- **Ontological Framework:**  
  The format is designed to capture the relationships between the various parameters. For instance, it defines how changes in osmotic pressure influence microbial metabolic activity and specifies the corresponding control actions. This structured, relational data approach ensures that the recipe is both machine-readable and human-interpretable, thereby facilitating reproducibility across different bioreactor systems.

- **Integration with Control Systems:**  
  The schema is intended for use with digital bioreactor control systems that can parse the YAML format and execute real-time adjustments based on sensor data. This integration allows for automated execution of the brewing process, ensuring that the defined parameters are maintained throughout fermentation.

- **Trademark and Reproducibility:**  
  By standardizing the way osmostatic brewing recipes are defined, the format not only enhances reproducibility but also creates a unique, trademarkable standard for osmostatic brewing methodologies.

**Claims (Draft):**  
1. A machine-readable specification format for encoding osmostatic brewing recipes, comprising fields for target product, microbial strain characteristics, environmental tolerances, and process control commands, wherein the format is defined in YAML.  
2. The format of claim 1, wherein the schema includes an ontological framework that captures the causal relationships between fermentation parameters and microbial responses.  
3. The format of claim 1, further comprising versioning features to support iterative refinement of biological recipes.  
4. The format of claim 1, wherein the standardized recipe format is capable of being trademarked as a unique identifier for reproducible osmostatic brewing processes.

**Preferred Embodiments:**  
Preferred embodiments include:
- A sample YAML schema detailing sections for `target_product`, `biomass`, `tolerances`, `controls`, and `version`.
- Integration of the schema with a Linux-based digital control module that can execute process commands in real time.

- Osmostatic brewing for high-stability, reproducible beverages.
- Biofuel production processes requiring precise microbial control.
- Pharmaceutical and biochemical manufacturing where consistency and process reproducibility are critical.
- Any industrial application where a standardized, reproducible recipe format can enhance process control and product quality.
