# JP7 Bioreactor Patent

**Title:** Modular Bioreactor System for Metabolic Control of Biological Processes

**Abstract:**  
This patent discloses a modular, sensor-integrated bioreactor system engineered to execute the JP7 Method. The system provides precise control over microbial metabolism under high-osmolality conditions through integrated sensors and a digital control interface that interprets YAML-based recipes. Although initially demonstrated with an osmostatic wine proof-of-concept, the bioreactor is suitable for a range of industrial applications including biofuel production and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

**Field of Invention:**  
The invention pertains to bioreactor systems and methods for controlling microbial metabolism via integrated sensor networks and digital control interfaces, particularly under conditions of high osmotic stress.

**Background:**  
Conventional fermenters lack the capability to operate at the extreme thresholds required for controlled osmolocking. This bioreactor system addresses these limitations with a robust physical design and a programmable digital control layer that manages critical environmental parameters in real time.

**Summary:**  
The bioreactor consists of a modular stainless-steel vessel with a cubic or square configuration, an inverted pyramidal drain for efficient evacuation, and multiple tri-clamp sensor ports. It is equipped with a Linux-based control module that executes YAML-defined recipes to modulate environmental parameters based on real-time sensor data, ensuring consistent and reproducible operation.

**Detailed Description:**  
- **Structural Design:**  
  Constructed from flat stainless steel panels (3–5mm thick) arranged in a modular, square configuration, with an inverted pyramidal bottom designed for complete drainage and ease of cleaning.
  
- **Instrumentation:**  
  The vessel is outfitted with multiple welded tri-clamp ports to facilitate the installation of various sensors (e.g., temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, specific gravity, gas flow, and turbidity sensors) necessary for monitoring the microbial process in real time.
  
- **Control System:**  
  A Linux-based digital control module is integrated into the system, logging sensor data and executing process adjustments based on YAML-defined recipes. This control interface can interact with external monitoring tools (such as Kafka and Grafana) for enhanced process visualization and remote management.
  
- **Operational Flexibility:**  
  The bioreactor is designed to support both manual interventions and automated controls. Its robust construction allows it to handle high osmotic pressures and other extreme conditions required for the JP7 Method, making it adaptable for a wide range of biological processes.
  
- **High-Stress Operation:**  
  The system is specifically engineered to maintain stability under conditions of high alcohol or solvent concentrations, and extreme osmotic pressures, ensuring that the microbial process can be precisely controlled without reliance on chemical preservatives or filtration.

**Claims (Draft):**  
1. A bioreactor system comprising a modular stainless-steel vessel with integrated sensor ports and a digital control module for managing microbial metabolism under high osmotic pressure.  
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the digital control module executes YAML-defined recipes that modulate environmental parameters based on real-time sensor data.  
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising an inverted pyramidal drain design facilitating complete evacuation and stratified product recovery.

**Preferred Embodiments:**  
Examples include configurations with built-in agitation systems (such as paddle or pump recirculation), external cooling or heating jackets for precise temperature control, and remote monitoring capabilities for real-time process management. The design is scalable from pilot-scale units (100–300L) to industrial-scale systems (1500L or more).

**Industrial Applications:**  
This bioreactor system is suitable for a variety of applications including biofuel production, pharmaceutical manufacturing, enzyme production, and any other industrial processes requiring precise control over microbial metabolism under challenging conditions.
