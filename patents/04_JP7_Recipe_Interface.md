# JP7 Recipe Interface Patent

**Title:** Bioprocess Recipe and Open-Loop Control Schema for Osmostatic Fermentation and Related Biological Reactions

**Abstract:**
This patent discloses a machine-readable interface for defining, monitoring, and verifying open-loop biochemical reactions, including osmostatic fermentation processes. The system captures the recipe-level intent and execution logic as well as runtime observations, catalyst interventions, and deviations in signature output. The format supports both YAML and alternative serialization structures such as JSON or TOML, making it suitable for integration with industrial control systems, cloud infrastructure, and hardware-native device protocols.

**Field of Invention:**
The invention relates to the interface between biochemical process planning and execution, providing a structured schema for reproducible reactions, control events, sensor telemetry, and forensic signature validation. It serves both human-readable documentation and machine-executable behavior for precision biological manufacturing.

**Background:**
Traditional recipe formats fail to capture the full complexity and variability of live biological reactions—especially under osmostatic stress. Instrumented bioreactors require standardized schema definitions to translate recipe logic into open-loop control instructions, and to correlate those instructions with sensor data and biochemical outputs over time.

**Summary:**
The schema is composed of two principal components:
- A **recipe specification**, including biomass, tolerances, environmental controls, catalysts, and final product targets.
- A **bioreactor log schema**, including timestamps, interventions, catalyst events, sensor data, fingerprint deviation scores, and verification outcomes.

This schema interface may be serialized in YAML, JSON, or equivalent structured formats and used for real-time control, post-hoc analysis, or ML/LLM-based training.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Recipe Format Structure:**
  - `target_product`: textual and structured description of intended output
  - `biomass`: microbial strain, performance curves, environmental tolerances
  - `tolerances`: osmotic pressure, alcohol/solvent limits, pH, temperature
  - `controls`: instruction list for control loops or discrete actions
  - `catalysts`: nutrient, sugar, or cofactor additions by volume, concentration, or time
  - `versioning`: format version, iteration lineage, changelog

- **Bioreactor Process Schema:**
  - `unit_id`, `batch_id`, `start_time`
  - Live sensor values (pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, ABV, CO₂ pressure, etc.)
  - Timestamped interventions and catalyst additions
  - Expected vs actual signature deviation scoring
  - Fingerprint validation and audit outcomes

- **Integration Targets:**
  - Compatible with log ingestion systems (Kafka, MQTT, filesystem, Prometheus)
  - Bioreactor CLIs and dashboards can render live process snapshots
  - Cloud or local automation systems can ingest logs for ML inference

- **Serialization Agnosticism:**
  The schema does not require YAML. Although YAML is commonly used for authoring recipes, the system is serialization-agnostic and may be implemented in JSON, CBOR, Protobuf, or other structured data representations. This ensures compatibility with embedded systems, HTTP APIs, databases, and industrial edge compute systems.

**Claims (Draft):**
1. A structured schema for defining a biological reaction process comprising target product goals, biomass tolerances, catalyst events, and control parameters.
2. The schema of claim 1, further comprising a logging format for timestamped observations and interventions during the bioprocess.
3. The schema of claim 1, wherein the control data is formatted for execution or monitoring via an open-loop industrial control system.
4. The schema of claim 1, wherein deviations from expected biochemical signatures are recorded and scored.
5. The schema of claim 1, wherein the schema is serializable in multiple formats including YAML, JSON, or equivalent.

**Preferred Embodiments:**
- A command-line interface or bioreactor control node capable of ingesting a recipe and process definition file in YAML, executing interventions and control loops, and exporting a real-time log in JSON.
- An interface that uses live fingerprint analysis (as defined in Patent 3) to signal whether process outcomes deviate from expected baselines.
- Full traceability from recipe definition to final batch signature, including catalyst history and microbial tolerances.

**Industrial Applications:**
- Osmostatic fermentation for high-ABV stabilized wine, cider, or spirit analogs
- Closed-loop and open-loop biofuel manufacturing pipelines
- Pharmaceutical bioreactor logging and batch validation
- Continuous improvement pipelines for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology
