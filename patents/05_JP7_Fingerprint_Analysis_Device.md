# JP7 Fingerprint Analyzer Patent

**Title:** Metabolic Signature Analysis and Bioprocess Inference System for Osmostatic Fermentation

**Abstract:**  
This patent discloses a diagnostic system for analyzing the chemo-physical fingerprint of products produced via osmostatic fermentation. The system is designed to measure a comprehensive metabolic signature—incorporating parameters such as residual solute concentration, alcohol or solvent content, osmotic pressure, viscosity, and key metabolite ratios—that reflects both the underlying recipe (as defined by the recipe interface) and the operational parameters of the bioreactor. By comparing the measured fingerprint against a standard reference profile, the system verifies product provenance, confirms process adherence, and detects potential intellectual property infringement. The device thereby provides essential quality control and forensic capabilities for industrial fermentation processes.

**Field of Invention:**  
The invention relates to diagnostic tools and methods for industrial biological processes. More specifically, it concerns systems for analyzing the metabolic fingerprint of products produced by osmostatic fermentation to infer process parameters, validate product authenticity, and identify potential process or intellectual property deviations.

**Background:**  
Industrial fermentation processes can exhibit significant variability, making it challenging to ensure consistency and to verify that a product was produced according to a specific patented process. Although separate components exist for process control (JP7 Method), bioreactor operation, and recipe specification, there remains a critical need for an integrated system that can capture the unique chemo-physical fingerprint of the final product. Such a fingerprint can serve as a forensic marker for product provenance and be used to detect unauthorized replication of the process.

**Summary:**  
The system utilizes advanced analytical techniques—such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, osmometry, refractometry, and viscometry—to measure key parameters of the fermentation product. These measurements yield a detailed metabolic fingerprint that reflects the interaction of the recipe and the bioreactor conditions. The fingerprint is then processed by pattern-recognition algorithms and compared against a database of standard profiles. The system outputs a diagnostic report that:
- Verifies whether the product matches the expected profile.
- Determines if the product was produced in accordance with the defined process.
- Flags deviations that may indicate process anomalies or potential intellectual property infringement.

**Detailed Description:**  
- **Analytical Techniques:**  
  The device captures measurements of residual solute (e.g., sugar or salts), alcohol or solvent concentration, osmotic pressure (mOsm/kg), viscosity (centipoise), and key metabolite ratios (such as glycerol-to-ethanol). Techniques such as GC-MS, NMR, osmometry, and refractometry are employed to obtain precise, repeatable data.
  
- **Data Acquisition and Processing:**  
  Sensor data is continuously or periodically collected and fed into an integrated processing unit. Advanced pattern-matching algorithms compare the acquired fingerprint with a reference profile that is derived from the known recipe parameters (Patent 4) and bioreactor operational data (Patent 2). This comparison is used to:
  - Confirm product provenance.
  - Validate that the process was executed as intended (as per the JP7 Method, Patent 1).
  - Detect deviations that might suggest process drift or unauthorized replication.
  
- **Diagnostic and Forensic Capabilities:**  
  The system generates a comprehensive diagnostic report that includes:
  - A conformity score indicating the degree to which the measured fingerprint matches the standard.
  - Detailed metrics for each measured parameter.
  - Alerts if any parameters fall outside predetermined tolerance bands.
  - Forensic markers that can be used to support claims of intellectual property infringement.
  
- **Integration with Control Systems:**  
  The fingerprint analyzer is designed to interface with the digital control systems of the bioreactor (Patent 2) and the standardized recipe format (Patent 4). This enables closed-loop feedback for real-time process adjustments and post-process verification of production parameters.
